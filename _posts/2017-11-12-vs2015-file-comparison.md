Just discovered a hidden tool inside visual studio 2015. Many times I have to compare different files to see the diff. So far all the solutions were outside the IDE, but not anymore.

Inside the visual studio 2015 open Command Window (CTRL + W, A) or View -> Other Windows -> Command Window and use the next command: **Tools.DiffFiles filePath1 filePath2**

Enjoy!
